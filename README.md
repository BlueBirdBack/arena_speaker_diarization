# ‚öî Arena Speaker Diarization üó£Ô∏è

This repository compares the performance of various AI models in solving the "Speaker Diarization" task. Speaker Diarization is the process of identifying different speakers in an audio recording and labeling which parts of the audio were spoken by each person.

For example, if you have a recording of a meeting with multiple participants, Speaker Diarization can automatically separate the audio into segments and label each segment with the corresponding speaker's name or ID. This makes transcripts and analysis of multi-speaker recordings much easier to follow.

The goal is to help users choose the best available Speaker Diarization model for their specific use case and requirements.
